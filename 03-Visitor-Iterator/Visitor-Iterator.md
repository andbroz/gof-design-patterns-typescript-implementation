# Visitor & Iterator Pattern

## Visitor

I have visitor Engine - i need to create and instantiate in my code
I give to visitor engine the Visitor
The Visitor Engine will make the http requests

it is a nice way to separate mechanincs of going trought the page api from what you want to do with the data

- Decoupling of data traversing and processing the result

## Iterator

It is basically the same as Visitor but Inverted.
We have our code that is getting iterator.
The iterator is making the http requests.
